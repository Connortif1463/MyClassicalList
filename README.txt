This is a .csv and corresponding .txt filewriter. 
It takes input of a piece and a composer and lists them with a 1 level sort.
It can also remove pieces by index and suggest random ones.

# DOCS:
- At the start of the program, type the name of an existing .csv file (without the extension) or its name will be used to write to a new file.

- All changes are overwrites for now, so be careful. 

- Execute the code by building it with the jdk on your system; do this because Intellij's exports have been dodgy and inconsistent.
